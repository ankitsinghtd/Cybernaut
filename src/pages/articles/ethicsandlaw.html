            <h1>Cyber Security Ethics and Laws</h1>
            <p class="article-intro">As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, the field of cyber security has
                become more crucial than ever. With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks and data breaches, it's
                essential to not only protect digital assets but also adhere to ethical principles and laws governing
                the cyber realm.</p>

            <h2>The Importance of Ethical Conduct</h2>
            <p>Cyber security professionals often deal with sensitive information and have the power to access, protect,
                and sometimes exploit digital assets. Ethical conduct in this field is paramount to maintain trust,
                privacy, and the integrity of data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Respecting the privacy and confidentiality of data, ensuring it is
                    not accessed or disclosed without proper authorization.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensuring data accuracy and preventing unauthorized modifications.</li>
                <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that data and systems are available to authorized users when
                    needed, and protecting against downtime due to cyberattacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> Treating all individuals and entities fairly and equally in
                    cyber security practices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Common Cyber Security Laws</h2>
            <p>Various laws and regulations have been established to govern cyber security practices and protect
                individuals and organizations. Some of the common cyber security laws include:</p>
